# Livable Streets Infrastructure Project

 <!-- DISPLAY=TRUE -->


This project, conducted in collaboration with BU Spark and Livable Streets, focuses on the impact of bike lanes on urban areas, specifically investigating the correlation between bike lanes and displacement, as well as their effect on small businesses. The research was mainly conducted in Boston and Chicago and involves surveying residents, collecting and analyzing data from various databases, and visualizing the results through graphs.

## Objectives

1. **Analyze the Correlation Between Bike Lanes and Displacement**
   - Investigate whether the introduction of bike lanes in neighborhoods correlates with resident displacement.
   - Study demographic changes over time in areas with newly implemented bike lanes.

2. **Study the Effect of Bike Lanes on Small Businesses**
   - Assess the impact of bike lanes on the economic activity of small businesses.
   - Survey business owners and patrons to gather qualitative data on their experiences and perceptions.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

- **Surveys**: Conducted surveys with residents and business owners to gather qualitative data on their experiences and perceptions of bike lanes.
- **Databases**: Fetched data from multiple sources, including city planning databases, business directories, and demographic statistics.

### Data Analysis

- **Pandas**: Utilized the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Created various graphs and visualizations to illustrate findings and trends.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for creating visualizations and graphs.

## Results

The findings of this project provide insights into the social and economic impacts of bike lanes in urban areas. The visualizations created using Pandas and Matplotlib effectively highlight trends and correlations discovered during the research.

## Conclusion

This project contributes to the understanding of how bike lane infrastructure affects urban dynamics, particularly in terms of displacement and the viability of small businesses. The research outcomes can inform city planners and policymakers in making data-driven decisions for urban development.
